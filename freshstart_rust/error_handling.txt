Unlike other programming languages Rust does NOT have exceptions. Instead, Rust broadly
groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable errors.

1) Recoverable errors: such as file not found error, in this case we may have to just
prompt the user to try again instead of stopping the execution of the program. For
such errors, Rust has the type Result<T, E>.

2) Unrecoverable errors: such as accessing a memory location, out of bounds of the array
in this case we'll want to immediately terminate the execution of the program. For such
errors the macro panic! is used.
