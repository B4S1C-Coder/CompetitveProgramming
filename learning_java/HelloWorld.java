// main method is the entry point of the program
// public: access modifier indicating that method is accessible outside the class
// static: indicates that method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class
// void: specifies that function does not return any value
// String[] args: method accepts array of strings as parameters, these are essentially the command line arguments
